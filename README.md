# Group Do: Designing your MVP

## Proposal
* With your group, answer each of the following questions:
  1. Who is your target audience?
  
     People who would like to keep track of their fitness goals/be part of a fitness-oriented community.

  2. What is the problem that the product will address?

    This will give users a comprehensive overview of how they are progressing with their fitness goals (active calories burned AND calories consumed)

  3. What is the primary goal of the product?

    To revolutionize the fitness industry and inspire people to take charge of their health and encourage them to make smart life choices.

  4. Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?

* Remember, your MVP should be the absolute *minimum* product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials.

* As an example, the essential features of an instagram-like application might look like:

  1. As a user, I want to keep track of the calories that I've burned during my workouts and calories that I've consumed during meals.
  2. As a user, I want to be able to receive objective metrics about my progress.
  3. As a user, I want to be able to be a part of a comminity that shares my fitness goals and can challenge each other to meet those goals. 

* Things like liking photos, sending photos to friends, making instagram stories, etc are cool, but they aren't essential. They should **not** be part of the MVP.
